The Archive of Acm Code
===
The Archive of Acm Code is my effor in my spare time. As an acmer, I love the acm competition and I am fond of  **algorithm** and **data structure**, I know how important they are. Therefore, I'll keep completing this archive:-)  

Since the code in this archive will most be used in `acm`, some of them i won't wrap them with class, in consideration of convenient usage. Additional, I generally prefer to use `C++` to implement algorithm.

The following is the code list, i will modify the list once i add new algorithm.  

Contact me if you have any problem.
